## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by creating a **GitHub Issue** in this repository. Include as much detail as possible to help me understand and address the issue effectively.

### What to include in your report:
- A clear and concise description of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- The affected versions (if applicable).
- Any known mitigations or workarounds for the issue.

### Additional Information:
Please note that this is a small side project, and while I take security seriously, I may not be able to address issues immediately. Your patience is greatly appreciated.

If you need an instant patch and are able to contribute, you are welcome to submit a pull request with a fix, linked to the appropriate issue. I will review it and accept it if it meets the necessary quality standards and resolves the issue.
