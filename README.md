[![Build and test API Server](https://github.com/Pandetthe/Snapflow/actions/workflows/api_build_and_test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Pandetthe/Snapflow/actions/workflows/api_build_and_test.yml)

This project is still under restructuring. The web client is currently not functioning properly due to changes in the API server.
If you are looking for a working version of the application, please check the [proof-of-concept branch](https://github.com/Pandetthe/Snapflow/tree/proof-of-concept).
Alternatively, if you are interested in tracking progress towards the MVP, please refer to this [roadmap](https://github.com/users/Pandetthe/projects/2).
